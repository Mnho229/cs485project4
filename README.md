Getting no signal here so communicate through here.  Our repo should be fine.  No need to start another one.
jesus these random styling for text.

Going to go ahead and make a launch pad for us.
// Alci: alrighty
// Mike: The type that the parser is going to read is going to be a struct with two strings inside.  That way, the parser will be able to tell both type and content.
PLANNING:

User Input Loop

Struct for scanner to parser

=======
Alci : Okay I'm gonna remove the extra text in here
