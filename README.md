CS 485 Project 4
Michael Ho / Alcy Holmes

Getting no signal here so communicate through here.  Our repo should be fine.  No need to start another one.
jesus these random styling for text.

Going to go ahead and make a launch pad for us.
// Alci: alrighty
// Mike: The type that the parser is going to read is going to be a struct with two strings inside.  That way, the parser will be able to tell both type and content.
// Mike: Also, please set your push thing to 'simple' so we don't overwrite each others work by accident.  here's console command
		git config --global push.default simple

Michael: Explain your question.
// Alci: Okay. I'm using sublime text to write my changes for the file. Is there a way for me to set my push so I don't overwrite on our work?

// Michael: Yeah.  We just have to make sure to tell each other when we are pushing so we can pull.  Plus, the commit system should provide a safety net for us if we overwrite by accident.  The above command I listed should also help.  I'm using Sublime right now to edit.



PLANNING:

User Input Loop

Struct for scanner to parser

"This is a string" -with more stuff added in

// Alci : What type should the token variable be? Does it depend on the certain things we are scanning for?
=======
Alci : Okay I'm gonna remove the extra text in here
// Alci: will that still work if I am using sublime text or my repository?
